Understanding of clustering we using for the learning of ANNOVA.
Dimension reduction:
It's neither supervised nor unsupervised. Analogy: It's like planet pluto, some called it planet and some not.
Data is not lost but reduced. For computational ease, face recognition and image compression.
PCA(Principal component analysis):
PCA helps in identify relation b/w columns
From the data we derive information. And try and reduce the information.
